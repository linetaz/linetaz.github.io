    <h1>
        Gustav Klimt (1862 - 1918)
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Austrian symbolist painter
    </h2>
    <p>
        Early in his career, he was a successful painter of architectural decorations in a 
        conventional manner. As he began to develop a more personal style, his work was the
         subject of controversy that culminated when the paintings he completed around 1900 
         for the ceiling of the Great Hall of the University of Vienna were criticized as 
         pornographic. He subsequently accepted no more public commissions, but achieved a new 
         success with the paintings of his "golden phase", many of which include gold leaf. 
         Klimt's work was an important influence on his younger peer Egon Schiele.
